									My undergraduate degree provided me with an excellent foundation in data collection, analysis, and presentation. 
									Key areas of study included Fluvial Systems, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, Natural Hazards, and Glaciology. I achieved 
									a 1st Class dissertation studying the effects of dam removal on planform river channel migration 
									downstream on the Elwha River, Washington, primarily using ArcGIS and Microsoft Excel.<br><br>
									Throughout my degree there was an emphasis on group fieldwork projects and presentations within which I 
									excelled. In the Lake District, UK, bedload transport and flood capacity of St John’s Beck was 
									analysed, and in the Arolla Valley, Switzerland, the avulsion frequency and surface evolution of the 
									Satarma debris fan was studied. In these tasks’ teamwork, 
									efficiency, and organisation were essential to complete comprehensive data collection, analysis, and 
									presentation within time restraints. 
									<br><br>Beyond subject-specific knowledge, my undergraduate education honed key transferable skills. I developed strong 
									problem-solving abilities, fostered critical thinking, and refined my report-writing skills. This well-rounded education 
									not only broadened my understanding of geospatial sciences but has also equipped me with a versatile skill set applicable 
									across various professional domains.

									During this internship experience I completed a flood modelling report for the ADB working in association with Landell Mills as part of 
									regional project focussed on strengthening integrated flood risk management across 8 countries in 
									South-East Asia. 
									<br><br>For this report I developed a 2D HECRAS flood model for the Chaung Magyi River 
									downstream of Sedawgyi Dam in Mandalay, Myanmar, assessing the impact of design flood events on 
									downstream populations. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in flood modelling, 
									remote sensing and GIS, using HECRAS, 
									QGIS, Google Earth Engine and SNAP, within which I developed a DEM from Sentinel-1 imagery.
									<br><br>
									I also assisted other sub-projects within the ADB scope included spatial analysis of flood model 
									projections in Pakistan. I worked on national sector assessments for the 8 countries, involving 
									data analysis and presentation in the form of maps and graphs for key indicators of social, economic, 
									and environmental development.<br><br>
									Further, I developed mapping for an AFD report on the development of 
									transboundary water management between Thailand and Cambodia, focussing on optimising water resources 
									in response to drought and flood impacts in the provinces of Beantey Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey.

								    This role began with a contract with MOWRAM (Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology), researching 
									water security in the Lower Mekong catchment. During this project I developed a full scale 2D HECRAS 
									flood model, aggregating data from numerous sources such as surveys, schematics, gauge data and flood 
									extents derived from satellite imagery to develop and calibrate the model.<br><br>
									Other projects included a flood hazard mapping project in the Chindwin and Central Ayeyarwady basin 
									in Myanmar, an ADB project in Indonesia with a focus of strengthening integrated flood risk management 
									and continuing some of the projects from my internship including the AFD transboundary project and the 
									ADB sector assessment study. 
									<br><br>These projects helped further develop my GIS, remote sensing, flood 
									modelling and data analysis skills, primarily using QGIS, HECRAS, Google Earth Engine, R and Excel.

								    This independent consulting contract involved developing a 2D HECRAS flood model of Battambang, Cambodia, 
									as part an 18-month project titled ‘Strengthening Climate Information and Early Warning System in 
									Cambodia to Support Climate Resilient Development and Adaptation to Climate Change’, under the Cambodia Climate 
									Change Alliance (CCCA) Innovation Project.<br><br>
									The model was built using a high 
									resolution DTM with a cross-sectional bathymetric survey and limited calibration data. Extensive analysis 
									of geospatial, hydrological, and meteorological data was completed using R and QGIS, with Machine Learning 
									used to classify land cover using Random Forest Methods.
									<br><br>This project improved my technical abilities using R, QGIS and 
									HECRAS, also providing great experience in independently developing and implementing a project under tight time restraints.</p>

								    My MSc experience greatly improved my technical ability to manipulate, store, analyse and present geospatial data
									using tools such as python, SQL, bash, R, QGIS and ArcGIS extensively. 
									<br><br>I also gained experience with web development 
									using HTML and CSS, multi- and hyperspectral image analysis using ERDAS Imagine, Agisoft Photoscan and 
									Google Earth Engine, and many intermediary projects combining these techniques.
									<br><br>
									A key component of this degree was team work, where we quickly had to implement work plans with a diverse range of 
									skills to meet short deadlines.
									<br><br>
									My dissertation was titled: <a href="https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~mscgis/21-22/s2121103/#section3"><strong>'Using Explorative 
										Network Analysis Methods to Investigate Edinburgh’s Road & Bus Networks in 
										the Context of Smart Cities'</strong></a>. The main premise was to use graphy theory to analyse various connectivity metrics 
										of Edinburgh's 
									road and bus networks to investigate variable relationships and possible optimisation. Self-organising maps were used to conduct 
									multi-variate analysis.<br><br>

								   My role as Product Development Analyst was centered in research & development, developing global scale geospatial data
								   products for historic, present, and climate-projected physical and transition risk indicators accessible 
								   via an API. Example datasets include global Sea Level Rise Exposure Risk and Wildfire Risk under 
								   different SSP climate scenarios for 2050 and 2100.
								   <br><br>This role greatly improved my ability to process, store and analyse vast amounts of geospatial data using Python, Bash and 
								   PostgreSQL, also exposing me to the AWS cloud infrastructure. 
								   <br><br>A key skill developed through this experience was my ability 
								   to automate tasks, optimising workflows from data ingestion to API product exposure, saving vast amounts of time to 
								   maximise efficiency and minimise error.</p>

								In my current position at Ecoonline I have continued to develop my technical skills using Python, Bash and PostgreSQL 
								with a greater focus on creating geospatial 
								and non-geospatial products which enable customers to comply with ESG frameworks such as TCFD, CSRD and CDP.
							    <br><br>
								With this new focus, I have gained greater experience using Python, Bash and PostgreSQL in non-geospatial workflows such as 
								dissecting vast framework pdfs into well structured excel files as part of our framework product workflow, and writing 
								scripts to automatically generate ESG audits as Powerpoints integrating our API product.
								<br><br>
								Looking forward, I intend to continue my technical skills development while taking on more responsibility and gaining greater 
								understanding in the role of geospatial data in the Social and Governance aspects of ESG.
